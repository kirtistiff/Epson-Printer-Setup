# How to Setup Epson Printer

## 1. Physical Setup
Unbox your Epson printer, plug in power, install ink cartridges, and load paper. Turn the printer on and follow any on‑screen startup prompts like language or alignment procedure.

## 2. Install Drivers & Software
Visit the official Epson support website, search your printer model, and download the full driver & utility package for your operating system. Alternatively, use the included installation CD (though online download ensures latest version).

## 3. USB Setup (Windows or macOS)
Connect the printer to your computer via USB. The OS often auto‑detects it and installs basic drivers. For full functionality, launch the Epson installer and choose the USB option, then follow on‑screen instructions.

## 4. Wireless Setup (Wi‑Fi)
- On the printer’s control panel, go to Wi‑Fi Setup Wizard or Network Setup menu. Select your SSID and input password securely.
- Alternatively, use WPS push‑button method if supported by your router and printer.
- After the printer joins the network, run the Epson driver installer on your computer and select Wireless Connection.

## 5. Ethernet Setup (for supported models)
Connect an Ethernet cable from the printer to your router. Ensure your computer is on the same LAN. Install Epson drivers and select network printer during installation.

## 6. Mobile Setup: Epson iPrint, AirPrint, Google Cloud Print
- Download Epson iPrint app on iOS or Android, connect your mobile device to the same Wi‑Fi network as the printer.
- On Apple devices, ensure AirPrint is enabled on the printer.
- Google Cloud Print is deprecated but some older Epson models support it through the Epson Connect Utility.

## 7. Epson Connect Printer Setup Utility
Install the Epson Connect Utility from Epson website. Register your printer account, assign a unique print‑by‑email address, and enable remote printing.
