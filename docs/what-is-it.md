# What Is an Epson Printer?

Epson is a well-known brand of inkjet and EcoTank printers that offer printing, scanning, copying, and sometimes fax functions. Models include standard ink-cartridge models and EcoTank refillable-ink systems like the popular ET-4850.

Epson printers support USB, wireless (Wi-Fi), and Ethernet connectivity, and many models include mobile printing support via Epson Connect, Epson iPrint, AirPrint, or Google Cloud Print.
