# Troubleshooting Tips

## Printer Not Detected
Ensure the printer is powered on, connected to the same Wi-Fi or network. Disable firewall/antivirus temporarily during installation.

## Wi-Fi Connection Errors
Double‑check SSID/password, move printer closer to router, or try WPS method.

## Ink Cartridge or Charging Errors
Ensure genuine Epson cartridges. If the initial ink charging step is skipped, use head‑cleaning and power‑clean routines to resolve blank pages.

## Paper Jams or Poor Print Quality
Clear paper jams manually; run nozzle check or printhead cleaning via maintenance tools in Epson software.

## AirPrint Not Working
Ensure Paper Setup Auto Display is enabled; disabling that may make AirPrint detection fail.

## Printer Driver Install Fails
Run installer as Administrator on Windows; ensure correct OS version; disable antivirus temporarily.

## Firmware or Software Updates
Use Epson Software Updater or driver package to keep firmware and drivers current to avoid bugs or compatibility issues.
